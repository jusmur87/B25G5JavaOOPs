# Task: Zoo Ecosystem Simulation
Overview : Design a software simulation for a zoo ecosystem. The simulation will focus
on different types of animals, their behaviors, and how they interact with their
environment. This task will involve creating a hierarchy of animal classes, implementing
interfaces for animal behaviors, and utilizing abstract classes and methods to define
common traits and actions.

## Part 1: Defining the Base Structure
Interface AnimalBehavior: Defines methods eat(), sleep(), and makeSound(). These
methods represent common actions that all animals in the zoo might perform, but the
specifics of these actions will vary depending on the animal type.
Abstract Class Animal: Implements AnimalBehavior. This class serves as the base for
all animal types, providing implementation for some methods of AnimalBehavior that
are common across all animals, such as sleep(), and defining abstract methods like
displayInformation() to show details about the animal.

## Part 2: Creating Specific Animal Classes
Class Mammal and Bird: Extend the Animal class. These classes will override the eat(),
makeSound(), and displayInformation() methods to provide specific behaviors and
information display mechanisms for mammals and birds, respectively.
Further Specialization: Within the Mammal and Bird classes, create specific animals,
such as Lion, Elephant (Mammals), and Parrot, Eagle (Birds). These specific animal
classes will override the methods from their parent classes to provide behaviors and
sounds unique to each animal.

## Part 3: Implementing Features Using OOP Concepts
Inheritance: Demonstrated by the class hierarchy starting from Animal to Mammal/Bird
to specific animals like Lion, Elephant, etc.
Polymorphism and Method Overriding: Specific animal classes overriding behavior
methods like eat(), makeSound(), and displayInformation().
Abstraction: The Animal class is abstract, containing both implemented and abstract
methods, enforcing a contract for the subclasses.
Interface Implementation: All animals implement the AnimalBehavior interface, ensuring
that they all provide implementations for the methods defined in the interface.
Constructors: Use in specific animal classes to initialize properties like name, age, or
any unique attributes they have.

## Task Objective:
Design the class structure as described, implementing the necessary methods and
properties.
Create a simulation where instances of different animals are created, and their behavior
methods are called to demonstrate polymorphism and method overriding.
Display information about each animal using the displayInformation() method to show
how data encapsulation and abstraction are used.
Testing Your Implementation
Instantiate various animals in a main method or equivalent entry point of your program.
Call the methods eat(), makeSound(), and displayInformation() on each instance to see
the polymorphic behavior in action.
